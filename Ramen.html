    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*</li>
        <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced</li>
        <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <p><h4>Cook the chicken</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375â„‰. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.</li>
        <li>Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the oven, transfer the chicken to a plate, and cover with foil until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><h4>Make the ramen broth</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.</li>

    </ol>

    <p><h4>Make the Soft-Boiled Eggs</h4></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil. Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8 minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes, transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to serve.</li>

    </ol>
    <p><h4>Assemble the Ramen Bowls</h4></p>
